# Texture Utility
Texture Utility's purpose is to speed up the workflow by negating the need to use other software for mundane texture edits and achieve the desired results directly in Unity.

## Features
- Resize, Rotate, Invert, Saturate, Hueshift and Colorize textures with Support for Masks.
- Quickly Create a Solid or Gradient colored texture.
- Unpack or Pack textures with color channels.
- Includes an Auto-Packing system to automatically pack a texture from its channels.
